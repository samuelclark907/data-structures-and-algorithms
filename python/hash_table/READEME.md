# Hashtables
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
O(n)
O(n)

## API
hash- hashes the key of a tuple
get- return the value of a givin key
set- takes that the hashed key and val and adds it too a hashtable
contains- checks if the hashtable contains the key and returns true or false
