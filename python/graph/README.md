# Graphs
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

AddNode()
Adds a new node to the graph
Takes in the value of that node
Returns the added node

AddEdge()
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
Include the ability to have a “weight”
Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph

GetNodes()
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

GetNeighbors()
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Takes in a given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

Size()
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph


## Approach & Efficiency
space - O(n)
time = O(n)

## API
no Api
